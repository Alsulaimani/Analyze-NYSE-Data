Project #2 in Business Analytics by Udacity

In this project we were asked to accomplish the following 

1. Create a powerpoint and identify a question and provide at least one visualization to help with your answer.

2. In ypour Excel sheet you must have the following:

  - Data file

  - Summary statistics

  - P&L Statement Dashboard which must have a drop-down list to pull historical fundamentals data 

  - Forecast scenarios

Kindly note that I had a problem with my excel while creating the drop-down list, so the drop-down list in the attached file is **NOT** acceptable by Udacity.
